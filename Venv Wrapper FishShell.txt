To start Fish Shell in VSCode simply type: fish
This is possible after setting the Fish as a default shell by typing: chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
Comming back to bash as an default shel: chsh -s /bin/bash

ONOTHER USEFULL COMMANDS:
find . -name virtualenvwrapper.sh
source ~/.bash_profile              after editing .bash_profile we reload the file to be sure if effects since beeing reloaded
