CREATING THE REQUIREMENTS.TXT file
--------------------------------------------

1) cd <project dir>
2) activate VIRTUALENV created and dedicated for this project (to check if it works write wrapper command: workon)
3) touch requirements.file          creates a file
4) pip list                         will show which I have installed in this virtual env 
5) pip freeze                       will show all but in the requirement file format
6) pip freeze > requirements.txt    Please note: a) pip freeze will dump current versions of all the installed modules on that system irrespective of there usage in the current project. b) pip will only list modules that have been installed via pip


pip install -r requirements.txt     will save all your python libraries with current version into requirements.txt file

TIPS BECAUSE OF WORKING WITH GIT:
1) remember to add the virtualenv for projest into .gitignore file. Just ann name of the environment like a file name

notes: 
Checking File Sizes
ls -l filename /* Size of the file*/
ls -l *        /* Size of All the files in the current directory */
ls -al *       /* Size of All the files including hidden files in the current directory */
ls -al dir/    /* Size of All the files including hidden files in the 'dir' directory */

Checking Directory sizes

du -hs .                    gives a total
du -h *                     for humen readable
du sh *
du -sh directory_name    /* Gives you the summarized(-s) size of the directory in human readable(-h) format*/
du -bsh *                /* Gives you the apparent(-b) summarized(-s) size of all the files and directories in the current directory in human readable(-h) format*/
